Hello fans of privacy! Soonmine likes privacy too! And we wanted to be very clear about what information we gather and how we use it. Please read this page to discover more and reach out to us with any questions or concerns!
</p>
<p>
Soonmine, LLC ("Soonmine", "our", "us" or "we") provides this Privacy Policy to inform Users (“users” or “you”) of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from Users of www.Soonmine.com (hereinafter “Soonmine"). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through Soonmine, and we, of course, reserve the right to update this policy from time to time as we see fit. Unless we specify otherwise, the terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as those defined in our Terms of Service. By creating an account with Soonmine, you agree to each of the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
1) Personal Information
Prior to creating an account with Soonmine, we potentially will ask you for personal information, meaning, among other things, information about you that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Information"). Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address, birthday, home address, phone number, credit card and other billing information, shipping address, and your friends’ and family’s email addresses. 
Users can choose not to provide us with any or all of the information we request, but refusing to provide some information may result in the limitation of some or all of Soonmine’s features. Users may login and/or create an account with Soonmine by entering email addresses and/or using third party (social networking site) login credentials. If you decide to create your Account by logging into a social networking site by way of Soonmine, Soonmine may extract the Personal Information you have provided to that social networking site such as your name, email address and other information you have made publicly available via that social networking site, from the account you have with the social networking site, and we may use that information to create your Account. The information we extract may depend on the privacy settings you have with the social networking site. Your account with Soonmine will be based solely on the Personal Information you voluntarily provide.  
</p>
<p>
We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your profile page on Soonmine, and we refer to this information as "Non-Identifying Information". Such information includes, but is not limited to: information regarding personal preferences and interests, information regarding clothing size, shoe size, or hat size, what special occasions you would like to receive gifts for, and whom you want Soonmine to notify on your behalf of your Soonmine page to prior to specified occasions. With regard to the contacts you would like Soonmine to notify prior to special occasions, you may add or remove such individuals, and Soonmine will use such contacts solely for the purpose of helping you receive the gifts you have identified on your Soonmine page. 
</p>
<p>
At times, Soonmine may use your Personal Information in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information to provide the optimal user experience of Soonmine and to carry out the intended functions of Soonmine and/or administer User inquiries.
</p>
<p>
Certain Non-Identifying Information may be considered a part of users’ Personal Information if it is combined with other identifiers in a way that helps Soonmine understand and identify its users. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when taken alone or combined with other non-identifying information. Soonmine may combine Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Soonmine Users to attempt to provide optimal services and to analyze and understand how Soonmine and its Utilities are being used. Soonmine also may use that information without aggregating it to serve specific Users, for instance to recommend a particular product according to preferences or restrictions, or to notify of a better price on a linked product.
</p>
<p>
Soonmine also may use Personal Information to contact users. We may send updates, newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may or may not be of interest to users. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive information or other communications from us, simply click the unsubscribe  function provided in any of the communications. Otherwise, please change your settings to reflect that you no longer wish to receive such communication from us.

Soonmine may use this information to monitor and analyze how Users are using Soonmine, for technical administration, to increase Soonmine’s functionality, and to better tailor Soonmine to the needs of Users and Non-Users. For example, some of this information is collected so that when Users return to Soonmine, Soonmine may recognize and advertise or give other information specific to your interests. Soonmine also may use this information to confirm that visitors to Soonmine meet the criteria required to process certain requests. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.
Soonmine also may collect information about the device visitors are using to view Soonmine, including the type of device it is, what operating system it utilizes, its settings, certain unique device identifiers, and/or crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings.
